## Opioid Treatment Centers in Indiana

Indiana has a significant opioid usage and addiction problem.  Part of the solution is
opioid treatment centers.  Some of the challenges are (1) do we have enough opioid treatment 
centers to handle the need and (2) are they located in such a way that we are reducing 
the barrier that travel represents to many people as much as possible.
```{r, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, message = FALSE}
library(leaflet)
df <- read.csv("OpioidTreatmentFacilitiesIN.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

a <- rep("<a href='http://", 13)
b <- rep("'>", 13)
c <- rep("</a>", 13)

treatSites <- paste0(a,df$website,b,df$name,c) 

df %>% 
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions(), popup = treatSites) 
```
